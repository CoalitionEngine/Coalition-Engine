This is what you can make your Undertale Fangame ideas come true.

> We value the perfect environment for your games.

To make this engine run perfectly on Low-End computers, We're trying our best to optimize our engine as much as possible.

> We hide your code from decompilers.

Messy code? Precious code? All of them can easily be seen by UndertaleModTool, but don't worry!
We are finding a way to hide your code. So no one will be able to see your code.
Don't want people to steal your assets? Don't want people to mod your games for fun/to cheat?
Fear not, the anti-export and save encryption is already a built-in feature of this engine, if people wants to see your protected assets or change some protected code, they will experience an error instead!

## Branch Purposes:

> Bleeding Edge : This will be getting the cutting edge updates, which means most likely it will cause unexpected errors or crashes.

> Beta : This branch will get updates less frequently than Bleeding-Edge, but this branch is for developers who want somewhat stable engine and frequently new features.

> Stable : When the feature is **completely** done and stable, It will move to the Stable branch. This branch is basically deprecated, you should not use this branch.

You are on the Bleeding Edge branch, This branch will have very unstable, unreliable builds. Yeah, most likely.

If you're lucky, you may get at least an useful build.

But the builds here will have the most updated features.

 ## Version List

The minimum Game Maker Version required is 2023.11.

These are the versions of the external libraries that are packaged with the newest version of the engine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should not remove libraries without '()' from the engine as they are essential for the engine to run.
