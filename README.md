# Coalition-Engine

This engine is based on Undertale, Created by Toby Fox.

This project was based on 2022.08 Gamemaker builds. So some older versions will not work correctly, or be Read-Only mode!

This engine is still unstable.

# The purpose of making this engine:

To make Low-End PCs work properly, Because TML's Engine is too unoptimized, Even Windows 7 VM with ram 4gb and 4 cores is laggy.

# Where to get contact/support:

Not yet, We'll consider making it after we finish the engine.
