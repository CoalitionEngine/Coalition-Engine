This is what you can make your Undertale Fangame ideas come true.

> We value Game's Perfect Environment.

To make this engine run perfectly in Low-End PCs, We're trying our best to optimize our codes as much as possible.

> We protect You, Developer's codes.

Messy codes? Precious codes? All of them are easily stolen by UndertaleModTool, but no worry!
We are finding a way to block your codes. So no one will be able to steal your codes. (Unless they can read disassembly codes, then there is this next feature that might help)
Don't want people to steal your assets? Don't want people to mod your games for fun/to cheat?
Fear not, the anti-export and save corruption is already a built-in feature of this engine, if people want to steal your protected assets or mod some protected codes, they will experience an error instead!

## Branch Purposes:

> Bleeding Edge : This will be getting the cutting edge updates, which means most likely it will cause unexpected errors or crashes.

> Beta : This branch will get updates less frequently than Bleeding-Edge, but this branch is for developers who want somewhat stable engine and frequently new features.

> Stable : When the feature is **completly** done and stable, It will move to the Stable branch. This branch is basically deprecated, you should not use this branch.

You are on the Beta branch. This branch will get somewhat more stable engine builds than Bleeding-Edge. If the current beta is considered to be completly safe and stable, It will move to Stable branch as well.

 ## Version List

The miniman Game Maker Version required is 2023.11.

These are the versions of the external libraries that are packaged with the newest version of the engine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should not remove libraries without '()' from the engine as they are essential for the engine to run.
