# Paradox-Undertale-Engine

This engine is based on Undertale, Created by toby fox.
This engine is still unstable.

# The purpose of making this engine:

To make Low-End PCs work properly, Because TML's Engine is too unoptimized, Even Windows 7 VM with ram 4gb and 4 cores is laggy.

# Where to get contact/support:

Not yet, We'll consider making it after we finish the engine.

# Credits:

Creators:
Maxin, Panthervention, Supereden, Pilzdeshimmels, RTF, (etc)

Special thanks to Scarm and snesmocha for the initial engine design and the board system.
