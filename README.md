# Paradox-Undertale-Engine

This engine is based on Undertale, Created by toby fox.
THIS ENGINE IS NOT COMPLETED YET. YOU MAY FIND BUGS!


# The purpose of making this engine:

You may not notice, TML's Engine is pretty unoptimized, Of course it's well-accurate to the original game, But Low-End PCs may not harmonize with the game.
Our goal is to optimize the engine as much as possible. Even the low-end pcs having 1000FPS!

# Where to get contact/support:

We still don't have any contacts such as Discord server.
